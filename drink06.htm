<p><a NAME="Tuborg"></a><a href="#index">Tuborg</a>
<p>At the end of last century (I mean the 19th), Nr Thue was a rich
<br>danish businessman. As all true nouveau riches, he wanted a house
<br>representative of his standing, so he had a castle built near Kopenhagen.
<br>Castles normally stand on hills or borgs, as the Danes call what
<br>they consider hills. Logically, Mr Thue's castle on the borg of
<br>Ryvangen became "Thuesborg". But Mr Thue had to flee Denmark,
<br>apparently for not paying back money loans. His castle was then
<br>bought by a Danish brewery which had at the same time made a
<br>new pils. Naturally they called it "Tuborg".
<p><a NAME="Vat 69"></a><a href="#index">Vat 69</a>
<p>Mr Sanderson, a Scottish distiller, set out in 1863 to create a new
<br>whisky. He made one hundred samples and invited his friends for a
<br>tasting. They agreed that the sample from the vat Nr 69 was the best.
<br>(Or maybe they just decided to call it a day after they had tasted
<br>sample Nr 69. I would have.)

<p><b>Various names have been added since the list was first completed:</b>
<p><a NAME="Number"></a><a href="#index">Number One</a>
<p>The absolute drink, just follow this link:
<br><a target=_top href="http://www.webtender.com/db/drink/1853">Worldwide top drink</a>
<p><a NAME="Jack"></a><a href="#index">Jack Daniel's</a>
<p>Jasper Newton Daniel, known as Jack, was a distiller in Lynchburg,
<br>Tennessee. He improved the local Bourbon by filtering it through
<br>maple charcoal. The result made Jack Daniel's Bourbon famous.
<p><a NAME="Kr"></a><a href="#index">Kr&ouml;ver Nacktarsch</a>
<p>A Rivaner, or as the Germans say, a M&uuml;ller-Thurgau from the
<br>German Mosel's little village Kr&ouml;v. Kr&ouml;ver Nacktarsch means
<br>"Naked ass from Kr&ouml;v". According to legend, in the middle ages,
<br>the local abbey owned all the wineyards in the area. The local serfs,
<br>the slaves of the Middle Age, had to work the monks' property and
<br>harvest the grapes. As "payment" for their services, they were
<br>allowed to keep one day's harvest to themselves. One year, the
<br>grapes were so excellent, the monks tried to find a way to cheat
<br>the locals out of their fair share. They added laxative salt to their
<br>serfs' food on "payment" day, so that the workers would have to
<br>run for relief while they were working. When the serfs noticed the
ruse,
<br>they sent only women into the wineyards who didn't wear anything under
<br>their workrobes. This way they could s... and work at the same time.
In
<br>other words, they harvested bar-butted.
<p><a NAME="McLaren"></a><a href="#index">McLaren</a>
<p>Shouldn't really be here, because it's not a drink in itself. The name
is
<br>of course most famous for Bruce McLaren and the F1 team he created
and
<br>which runs as strong as ever today, but McLaren is also the name of
a
<br>valley in Australia with a reputation for growing some of Australia's
<br>finest white wines. And since Australians are growing great wines,
<br>McLaren, as a good one among the good ones, must be something really
nice.
<br>Never had a chance to try, but then I never sat in a McLaren either.
<p><a NAME="Paulaner"></a><a href="#index">Paulaner Salvator</a>
<p>A Double Bock beer brewed by the monks of St Paul. It is a very
<br>"nourrishing" beer, therefore the monks considered it the liquid equivalent
<br>of bread, which had a nice side-effect. As it was "bread", you could
"eat"
<br>it during Feast and you wouldn't be sinning. Neat, no?
<p><a NAME="Pontarlier"></a><a href="#index">Pontarlier</a>
<p>One of the finest pastis, produced in Pontarlier. Unfortunately, as
many
<br>small French producers, the company refuses to export its product because
<br>of the humunguous amount of French export paperwork to fill out which
<br>would make any export unprofitable. Again, due to French bureaucratic
<br>overload, the Pontarlier is only sold in the area around the city of
Pontarlier.
<br>If you like your pastis and you're ever in that part of France, try
it, you'll like it.
<p><a NAME="Rivaner"></a><a href="#index">Rivaner</a>
<p>Rivaner is a Luxembourg word creation. The same wine is known in Germany
<br>as a M&uuml;ller-Thurgau. Rivaner is widely believed to be short for
Riesling
<br>and Silvaner, which might be true, but DNA analyses proved that the
<br>Rivaner grape is originally a blend of Riesling and Chasselas, a Swiss
<br>white close very similar to Silvaner. Indeed, the creator of the Rivaner
<br>is a Swiss wine grower, Mr M&uuml;ller-Thurgau, who was an oenologist
from
<br>Chasselas.
<p><a NAME="Walker"></a><a href="#index">Johnnie Walker</a>
<p>Since the early 19th century, the Walker family ran a hardware-drugstore
<br>in Kilmarnock, Scotland. The father, John Walker, distilled a whisky
<br>on the side, strictly for family use, but his scotch was so fine his
son
<br>Alexander started selling to the store's clients, and better yet, to
all
<br>the salesmen that came to visit him, a pretty neat way of getting the
<br>Walker whisky known as the salesmen would spread the word. In fact,
its
<br>reputation grew so much that in 1880 Alexander opened a store in
<br>London to sell the "Walker's Kilmarnock Whisky" all over the empire.
<br>At this same time, phyloxera destroyed the French wineyards. As a
<br>side-effect, Cognac came into short supply because of wine- and winebarrel
<br>shortage and England was ready for some decent home-brew. Around
<br>1900, the company decided to rename its whisky Johnnie Walker
<br>and they put the old man's picture on their label. Johnnie Walker
<br>started coming to every house.
